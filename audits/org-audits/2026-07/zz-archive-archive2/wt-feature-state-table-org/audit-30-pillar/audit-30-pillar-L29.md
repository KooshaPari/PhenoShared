# L29 — Repository governance (license / CI / license-check / CODEOWNERS)

**Owner:** forge-A15 (DX+quality)
**Bloc scope:** AgilePlus + thegent + Tracely + Tracera (4 repos, federated via thegent's governance stack)
**Cross-cuts:** L10 (CI SHA-pinning), L11 (quality gates), L13 (contributor DX), L23 (audit log)

## Scope

Repo-level governance primitives that make a repo production-grade at the project/collaboration layer: `LICENSE` files (top-level), dual-licensing files, `CODEOWNERS` (root + `.github/CODEOWNERS`), GitHub **rulesets** (the SOTA replacement for legacy branch protection — JSON-encoded branch policies), `required-checks` JSON, issue templates (`bug.yml`, `feature.yml`, `config.yml`, `security.yml`), PR templates, `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` / `SECURITY.md` / `FUNDING.yml` / `GOVERNANCE.md` / `CONSTITUTION.yaml`, and federated governance layering (thegent's `RULESET_BASELINE.md` + `rulesets/main.json` + `required-checks.json` + `CONSTITUTION.yaml`). Distinct from L10 (which is *which* CI actions are SHA-pinned); L29 is the *governance substrate* those actions run on.

## SOTA 2026

- **GitHub Rulesets** (replaces legacy branch protection, May 2022+) — JSON-encoded branch policies, `enforcement: "active"`, `conditions.ref_name.include: ["~DEFAULT_BRANCH"]`, `rules: [deletion, non_fast_forward, pull_request]` with `required_approving_review_count: 1` + `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: true` + `require_code_owner_review: true` + `required_review_thread_resolution: true`. Stored as `.github/rulesets/main.json` for repo-local + `phenoShared/.github/rulesets/*.json` for federated.
- **CODEOWNERS at `.github/CODEOWNERS`** (SOTA canonical location) **+** `/CODEOWNERS` (legacy root location, kept for non-GitHub tools). Per-component drill-down for monorepos. Default owner catches all.
- **LICENSE at root** + dual-licensing companion files (`LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`) for `MIT OR Apache-2.0` projects. SPDX identifier matches Cargo.toml `[package].license`.
- **Issue templates as `.yml`** (GitHub Forms format) + `config.yml` with contact links (`Security Policy`, "Report a security vulnerability"). `security_report.md` is the SOTA intake for coordinated disclosure.
- **PR template** at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with required sections (`## What*`, `## Why*`, `## How tested*`, `## Risk`, `## Rollback`) and explicit `*` markers for required fields.
- **Federated governance layers** — `CONSTITUTION.yaml` (immutable principles), `RULESET_BASELINE.md` (human-readable ruleset mirror), `rulesets/*.json` (machine-readable ruleset), `required-checks.json` (job-name → required mapping), `GOVERNANCE.md` (operational policy). Each layer is independently auditable; drift between layers is a CI failure.
- **`FUNDING.yml`** with at least one of: `github: [username]`, `custom: ["https://..."]`, `open_collective:`, `patreon:`. SOTA 2026 also includes `tidelift: "..."` for OSS security maintenance.
- **Required status checks** — declared in `required-checks.json` + enforced via rulesets `required_status_checks` (SOTA rulesets v2) or `branch_protection.required_status_checks.contexts` (legacy).

## Gaps

1. **Tracely + Tracera CODEOWNERS have no per-component drill-down** — `Tracely/CODEOWNERS:1-4` and `Tracera/.github/CODEOWNERS:1-6` are single-rule `* @<REDACTED>`. Thegent has 30+ per-component rules; AgilePlus has 30+ per-crate + per-language rules. Tracely has a `crates/` workspace and Tracera has a `crates/tracera-core/` subcrate but neither is drill-down-owned. — **effort: S** (add 5-10 lines per repo for `crates/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, sensitive files)
2. **Tracera declares `MIT OR Apache-2.0` in `Cargo.toml:7` but only ships `LICENSE` (MIT) at root** — the Apache companion file is missing. This is a *legal* gap: downstream users cannot verify the Apache-2.0 grant. — **effort: S** (copy `AgilePlus/LICENSE-APACHE` (10,957 bytes) to Tracera + `LICENSE-MIT` companion file)
3. **Thegent's `LICENSE-APACHE` is only 104 bytes — header-only, not the full Apache text** — `ls -la` showed 104 bytes vs AgilePlus's 10,957 bytes. The 104-byte file is just the SPDX short-form header, not the actual license grant. Thegent `Cargo.toml` (or PyPI metadata) cannot legally grant Apache-2.0 without the full text. — **effort: S** (copy `AgilePlus/LICENSE-APACHE` over the 104-byte stub)
4. **No JSON ruleset artifact in AgilePlus, Tracely, or Tracera** — only thegent has `.github/rulesets/main.json` (the SOTA artifact). The other 3 repos rely on GitHub UI-managed branch protection, which is not auditable from the repo. Without `rulesets/main.json`, the `RULESET_BASELINE.md` declarations in thegent are not symmetric across the bloc. — **effort: M** (port `thegent/.github/rulesets/main.json:1-38` to the other 3 repos, adjusting per-repo rules)
5. **Thegent's `.github/CODEOWNERS:1-12` is less granular than the root `CODEOWNERS:1-50`** — root has 30+ per-component rules, `.github/CODEOWNERS` has only 8. GitHub prefers `.github/CODEOWNERS` (canonical location); the root file is shadowed. This means the more granular ownership is the *less authoritative* one. — **effort: S** (move the 30+ rules from root to `.github/CODEOWNERS`; keep root as a 1-line alias)
6. **Thegent has 1 workflow in `backup/`** — `thegent/.github/workflows/backup/security-deep-scan.yml` is archived in a subdir, but GitHub Actions **does not run workflows in subdirectories** by default. This means the Trivy scan is dead — it never executes. — **effort: S** (move to root `.github/workflows/` or wire via `workflow_run` trigger)
7. **Tracely's LICENSE copyright is `2024 <REDACTED>`** — `Tracely/LICENSE:1` says `Copyright (c) 2024`. The repo was actively developed through 2026 (CHANGELOG.md shows recent work). Without copyright-year updates, downstream users may question the recency of the grant. SOTA practice: either bump the year, or include a range `2024-2026`. — **effort: S** (update to `2024-2026 <REDACTED>`)
8. **Tracera has no `FUNDING.yml`** — neither root nor `.github/`. The other 3 repos expose at least one funding channel. — **effort: S** (copy `Tracely/FUNDING.yml` pattern with `github: [<REDACTED>]`)
9. **Only thegent has federated governance layers (`RULESET_BASELINE.md` + `required-checks.json` + `CONSTITUTION.yaml` + `GOVERNANCE.md`)** — the other 3 repos have no `GOVERNANCE.md`, no `CONSTITUTION.yaml`, no `required-checks.json`. The thegent governance stack is not federated to the bloc. — **effort: M** (port `thegent/.github/RULESET_BASELINE.md` + `thegent/.github/required-checks.json` to a `phenoShared/` org-level repo, then `uses:` from the other 3)
10. **Tracely's `Tracely/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md:1-10` is a near-duplicate of Tracera's** — the `## What*` template is identical. Without a `## Risk` or `## Rollback` section, the template does not enforce security-impact disclosure. The thegent and AgilePlus templates have the same issue. — **effort: S** (add `## Risk*` and `## Rollback*` sections across all 4)
11. **Tracely/Tracera have no `RULESET_BASELINE.md` at root** — only thegent does. Without the human-readable ruleset mirror, code review cannot reference the canonical branch policy from PR comments. — **effort: S** (port `thegent/.github/RULESET_BASELINE.md:1-44` to each repo's root)
12. **Tracely's `CODEOWNERS` uses `@<REDACTED>` (capital K) but Tracera and thegent use `@<REDACTED>`** — GitHub username lookups are case-insensitive but log-audit tools and CODEOWNERS diff tools are case-sensitive. The bloc should standardize. — **effort: S** (one-shot find-replace)
13. **Tracera's `CODEOWNERS` is in `.github/CODEOWNERS:1-6` only** — no root `/CODEOWNERS` alias. Per the file's own comment "later rules override earlier ones" and per AgilePlus's pattern, having both is the SOTA defense-in-depth. — **effort: S**
14. **Tracely's `RULESET_BASELINE.md` is missing the `Repo-Local Governance Gates` list** that thegent has — thegent's baseline documents the 5 workflow-based gates (`policy-gate`, `pr-governance-gate`, `sast-quick`, `codeql`, `security-guard`) and their relationship to the ruleset. The other 3 repos have CI jobs but no documented gate list. — **effort: S** (add to each repo's `RULESET_BASELINE.md` after porting)

## Recommendations

1. **Port `thegent/.github/rulesets/main.json:1-38` to AgilePlus, Tracely, Tracera** — same shape, per-repo tweaks. The bloc should have auditable branch policy as code, not as GitHub UI state. Effort: M.
2. **Port `thegent/.github/RULESET_BASELINE.md:1-44` + `thegent/.github/required-checks.json:1-9` to the other 3 repos' roots** — establish the bloc's governance as a 4-repo stack. Effort: S per repo.
3. **Backfill Tracera's `LICENSE-APACHE` and `LICENSE-MIT`** — copy from `AgilePlus/LICENSE-APACHE` (10,957 bytes, full text). Fix the thegent `LICENSE-APACHE` (replace 104-byte stub). Effort: S each.
4. **Consolidate thegent's CODEOWNERS** — make `.github/CODEOWNERS:1-12` the canonical (30+ rules), keep root `/CODEOWNERS` as a 1-line alias. Effort: S.
5. **Move thegent's `backup/security-deep-scan.yml` to root `.github/workflows/`** — the Trivy scan is currently dead. Effort: S.
6. **Add per-component CODEOWNERS drill-down to Tracely + Tracera** — even 5-10 lines per repo for `crates/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, sensitive files. Effort: S per repo.
7. **Add `## Risk*` and `## Rollback*` to all 4 PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** — enforce security-impact disclosure at PR intake. Effort: S.
8. **Create a federated `phenoShared/.github/` org-level repo** with the canonical `RULESET_BASELINE.md`, `required-checks.json`, `CONSTITUTION.yaml`, and `GOVERNANCE.md`. Each of the 4 repos can `uses:` the ruleset JSON or symlink the markdown. Effort: M (one-time setup, then 4 small follow-ups).
9. **Bump Tracely's LICENSE copyright to `2024-2026`** — SOTA practice is a year range covering active development. Effort: S.
10. **Standardize CODEOWNERS casing** — pick `@<REDACTED>` (lowercase, matches Tracera + thegent) and apply to Tracely. Effort: S.
11. **Add `FUNDING.yml` to Tracera** — copy `Tracely/FUNDING.yml` (github + custom). Effort: S.
