//! # fabric-graph
//!
//! Topology graph model and route compiler for Phenotype Fabric.
//!
//! This crate is the **graph-native** core. It is read-only with respect to
//! execution; it produces route plans that the runtime then enacts.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`model`]: graph types — nodes, edges, capabilities, intents, topology epoch
//! - [`builder`]: ergonomic constructors and builders for graphs and intents
//! - [`negotiation`]: the negotiation algorithm — score routes against intents
//! - [`compile`]: produce route plans from intents against a topology
//! - [`score`]: scoring functions (locality, latency, capability, trust)
//! - [`planner`]: long-horizon planner for batch/sequence intents
//! - [`failover`]: re-plan around failed nodes when a route's steps fail (PF-WP-021, spec 019)
//! - [`surface`] / [`surface_ops`] / [`lease_fsm`]: surface plane types + lease FSM (PF-WP-015,
//!   spec 019)
//! - [`decision`]: Admit / AdmitWithNotes / Reject + Severity reducer (mirrors
//!   cmd/checker/decision.go)
//! - [`leases`]: single integration entry point that wires `failover::replan` to the surface plane
//!   (PF-WP-022, spec 020)
//! - [`leases_fairness`]: multi-tenant fairness queue + `pardon()` operator escape hatch (PF-WP-022
//!   v2, spec 022)
//!
//! ## Non-negotiable invariants (PF-FR-002..005)
//!
//! 1. Every edge carries a locality tier (L0..L8). An edge without one is invalid.
//! 2. Every node carries a signed capability descriptor (or None for "unprobed").
//! 3. The topology epoch is a first-class property of every route plan. Plans pin to the epoch they
//!    were compiled against and refuse to be enacted on a different epoch without a re-negotiation
//!    step.
//! 4. The graph is the *truth* of physical layout. Anything not in the graph does not exist for
//!    placement.
