//! # fabric-workspace
//!
//! Persistent seat-lease management for Fabric. A *workspace* is a
//! [ADR-0025](https://phenotype-fabric/adr/0025) instantiation of a
//! compiled [RoutePlan] — it binds the route's steps to a real seat
//! (a `LocalityTier` instance on a concrete host), tracks the seat's
//! state through a 5-state FSM, and persists the binding to disk so
//! that other Fabric-aware tools (thegent, ShareCLI, IDE-bridge) can
//! observe the running seat.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! Unassigned ──assign_plan──► Assigned ──claim_seat──► Active
//!                                                       │
//!                                                       │ complete()
//!                                                       ▼
//!                                          Completed / Failed / Cancelled
//! ```
//!
//! Seat leases have their own FSM: Pending → Active → Released/Failed/Revoked.
//!
//! ## Conflict detection
//!
//! A workspace is *conflicting* if it claims a seat that is already claimed by
//! another active workspace. The detection is a single pass over the active
//! set; conflict resolution is **operator-driven** (the
//! `fabric workspace list --conflicts` command shows the overlap, and
//! `fabric workspace release <id>` makes room).
//!
//! ## Stability
//!
//! R0 release: STABLE for the seat-lease model itself (Pending→Active→terminal),
//! EXPERIMENTAL for the on-disk format (may change before R1).
