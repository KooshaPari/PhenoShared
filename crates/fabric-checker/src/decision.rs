//! Decision taxonomy for `fabric-checker`.
//!
//! See ADR-0027 for the rationale. A `Decision` is the answer to one
//! question: "is this host + this manifest combination admissible for
//! placement?"  Three answers, no more:
//!   * `Admit`         — every requirement satisfied with at least Margin=0.
//!   * `AdmitWithNotes` — admissible but with at least one advisory (e.g.,
//!                        `AcceleratorMissing` for an optional GPU).
//!   * `Reject`        — at least one hard requirement is not met.
//!
//! Reasons are the evidence: every `Decision` carries one or more
//! `CheckOutcome`s. The `Severity` is `Hard` (block) or `Soft` (advisory).
//!
//! The `ReasonCode` enum is the exhaustive set of machine-readable reason
//! codes a checker may emit. Tests in `tests/reason_codes.rs` lock the
//! wire format — changing a name is a breaking change.
