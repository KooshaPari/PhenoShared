# Evidence Index — asks/instinct coverage corpus

## Why this directory exists

The entire evidence base for this work previously lived only under
`~/CodeProjects/temp/asks-coverage`, which is a **volatile scratch path**: it may be
wiped periodically and on reboot. This directory makes the *derivable* parts of that
corpus durable and repo-tracked.

**The full mined corpus is NOT copied.** It is roughly 612 MB on disk across the
`mined/*.jsonl` files (the largest are `intent.jsonl` ~224 MB, `forge_clean.jsonl`
~186 MB, `forge.jsonl` ~186 MB, `jcode.jsonl` ~39 MB). Those remain volatile and are
not recoverable from this repo. What is preserved here is the **schema, the per-source
manifests, and the human-readable analysis reports**, which are sufficient to describe,
re-validate and re-derive the corpus from the original local sources.

## Note on the manifests

`_MANIFEST.json` and `_MANIFEST.backup.forge.json` are byte-identical in intent but the
backup was written before the `forge_clean` pass. `forge_MANIFEST.json` is likewise the
pre-clean version. All three are retained so the clean/raw distinction stays auditable.

## Reproducing the corpus

Regeneration depends on local source artifacts at their original locations (jcode/kcode
session stores, Codex rollouts, Forge/Herdr/iMessage exports). Those sources are outside
this repo and unchanged by this copy. If the volatile JSONL is lost, it can be re-mined
from those sources; the manifests here record what the previous run contained.
