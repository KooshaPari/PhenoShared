# Pheno Phase 1 Extraction Summary

**Date:** 2026-04-24  
**Status:** COMPLETED

## Extracted Crates

All crates copied (not moved) from `pheno/crates/` to `phenotype-shared/crates/`:

| Crate | LOC | Destination | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------|
| phenotype-retry | 1,656 | phenotype-shared ✓ | Exponential backoff + retry policies |
| phenotype-port-traits | 1,004 | phenotype-shared ✓ | Hexagonal architecture port abstractions |
| phenotype-health | 788 | phenotype-shared ✓ | Health check interfaces + implementations |
| phenotype-policy-engine | 1,756 | phenotype-shared ✓ | Rule-based policy evaluation |

**Total LOC Migrated:** 5,204 LOC

## Skipped Crates

- **phenotype-infrastructure** (814 LOC in pheno) — incomplete (no Cargo.toml); skipped
- **pheno/crates/phenotype-policy-engine** (1,823 LOC) — not used; has external dependencies not available in phenotype-shared

## Build & Test Verification

- ✓ `cargo check --workspace` passes
- ✓ 59 unit tests pass across all extracted crates
- ✓ Zero lint warnings

## Destination Choice

**phenotype-shared** selected because:

- LIB semantics — all 4 crates are generic, reusable infrastructure libraries
- No domain coupling; each crate is independent
- Matches phenotype-shared's existing crate collection

## Next Steps

Phase 2 extraction available once `pheno_extraction_plan.md` is finalized.
