# User Story -> Journey -> FR Traceability Map

- **Repo:** PhenoProject
- **Authoritative FR doc:** [`FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md`](../../FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md)
- **Journey standard:** [`docs/operations/journey-traceability.md`](../operations/journey-traceability.md)
- **Status date:** 2026-06-05
- **Note:** All seven FRs are stubs (`Status: Stub`, `Test Status: Not yet written`). Source / test / journey columns are populated where the existing code/test layout already maps to the intent,
  and `[ ]` boxes mark which rows still need a journey manifest, code, test, and gate wired up. The FR-005 / FR-006 / FR-007 rows are the lowest-coverage rows because they have no test or journey
  artifact yet.

## Legend

- **Code:** Source path(s) that implement the story today.
- **Tests:** Test path(s) that exercise the code (or `none` if only a smoke import exists).
- **Journey:** Path to a journey manifest/evidence bundle, or `none` if not yet produced.
- **Gate:** The CI workflow that should enforce the row (or `none` if missing).
- **Checkboxes** track the four artifacts the row needs: journey manifest, code, test, gate.

## Coverage Summary

| FR id | Code present | Test present | Journey manifest | Gate wired | Coverage |
|-------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------|----------|
| FR-001 | yes | yes (contract + smoke) | planned | partial | medium |
| FR-002 | yes | yes (cycle contract) | planned | partial | medium |
| FR-003 | yes | yes (codemods + KaskMan) | planned | yes | high |
| FR-004 | yes | yes (live/pdf unit) | planned | yes | high |
| FR-005 | yes | no | no | no | low |
| FR-006 | yes | partial (auth touches settings only) | no | no | low |
| FR-007 | yes | yes (api token only) | no | no | low |

## Lowest-Coverage Stories (Top 3)

1. **FR-005 Artifact generation and publishing** - no test, no journey manifest, no dedicated gate. Only Dockerfiles and a `deployments/` directory exist.
2. **FR-006 Configuration management** - only one contract test (auth/instance setup) tangentially covers settings; no journey and no dedicated gate. Surface spans `.env`, Doppler config, and Django settings.
3. **FR-007 Integration with external services** - only the API token contract test exists; webhook, exporter, and license flows have no dedicated tests, no journey evidence, and no gate.

## Next Actions

- [ ] Flesh out FR-001..FR-007 descriptions in `FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md` (currently empty stubs).
- [ ] Add a journey manifest JSON for each of the seven stories under `docs/journeys/manifests/`.
- [ ] Add Playwright e2e coverage for at least one story per gate (FR-005/006/007 are the biggest gaps).
- [ ] Wire `.github/workflows/fr-coverage.yml` to a real FR/test parser (currently a no-op echo step).
